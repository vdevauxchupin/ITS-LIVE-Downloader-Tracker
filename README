# Notebooks to download ITS-LIVE yearly and daily datacubes

First: download files with the "Download_Cubes" notebook
Second: run the Tracker_Strains notebook


IMPORTANT: In the Tracker_Strains notebook, you will have the option to calculate the flux divergence.
To do that you NEED to have a glacier thickness tif, and a csv file with point's coordinates along the boundaries of the glacier.

There are template files in the folder Example_Qdiv, which shows you how to organize your csv file (x in one column, y in the other).
Just make sure your files are in the same projection as the datacubes you are using.
